 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let Name = ("Sunaina")
print("I chose constant beacause a person's name does not change")
var Age = 15
print("I chose variable because age changes every year")
var NumberOfStepsToday = 2000
print("I chose variable because the number of steps are constantly changing")
let StepsGoal = 10000
print("I chose constant because the goal for the day is the same everyday")
var AverageHeartRate = 89
print("I chose variable beacause your heart rate is constantly changing")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
